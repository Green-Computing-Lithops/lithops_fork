The Python library perf for energy consumption measurement on Linux offers several events to measure energy usage. Here's a detailed list of the energy-related events:

1. power:cpu_energy - Measures CPU package energy consumption
2. power:cpu_frequency - Captures CPU frequency changes
3. power:cpu_idle - Tracks CPU idle states
4. power:powercap_energy - Measures energy via the powercap interface
5. power:rapl - Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) interface events
6. power:thermal_event - Tracks thermal events like throttling
7. power:battery - Battery charge/discharge events
8. power:wakeup_source - System wakeup sources tracking
9. power:acpi_power_meter - ACPI power meter readings
10. power:system_suspend - System suspend/resume events

Each event provides different insights:

- The RAPL interface (power:rapl) is particularly useful as it accesses Intel's built-in energy counters
- power:cpu_energy gives a direct measurement of CPU package power consumption
- power:powercap_energy works with the Linux powercap subsystem
- Battery events track discharge patterns over time
- CPU idle and frequency events help correlate power usage with processor states

To use these events with the perf tool, you would typically run commands like:

```bash
perf stat -e power:cpu_energy your_program
```

Here's a detailed list of perf energy-related events with their specific command syntax:

```bash
power/energy-cores/            # CPU cores energy consumption in Joules
power/energy-pkg/              # Full CPU package energy consumption in Joules
power/energy-ram/              # DRAM/memory energy consumption in Joules
power/energy-gpu/              # Integrated GPU energy consumption in Joules
power/energy-psys/             # Platform/system level energy in Joules
```

These events leverage Intel's RAPL (Running Average Power Limit) interface which provides hardware counters for energy consumption. The values are reported in Joules, and the counters are updated approximately every millisecond.
